# **App Name**: Network Guardian

## Core Features:

- Device Discovery: Instantly scan and identify all devices connected to the WiFi network, displaying IP, MAC address, device name, and type.
- Device Management: Allow authorized users to block, unblock, or pause internet access for individual devices on the network. Also allow to modify advanced settings such as DNS, DHCP settings, and custom firewall rules for each device.
- Access Scheduling: Enable scheduled WiFi access restriction, automatically limiting access based on predefined time intervals for each device. Includes smart scheduling suggestions based on user activity patterns.
- Secure Access Control: Implement a secure multi-user access system, allowing only authorized users to manage the network via tokens or credentials. Features biometric authentication and role-based access control.
- Logging and History: Maintain a comprehensive log of all actions performed within the application for auditing and tracking purposes. Includes advanced filtering and export options for detailed analysis.
- Threat Detection: Leverage a generative AI tool to suggest potentially compromised or misconfigured devices, incorporating real-time threat intelligence feeds. This is a tool that decides when to incorporate information in its output.
- Anomaly Detection: Employ machine learning algorithms to detect unusual network activity patterns, such as excessive bandwidth usage or unauthorized device connections. Generates alerts and automated responses to potential security breaches.
- Network Visualization: Provide an interactive visual representation of the network topology, displaying device connections, data flow, and security status in real-time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke security and stability.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8EAF6) for a clean and non-intrusive interface.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00BCD4) to highlight important actions and interactive elements, creating contrast against the primary color.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet approachable text, suitable for both headlines and body.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent devices and actions. Consistent styling across all icons. Leverage a custom icon set designed specifically for network security applications.
- Organize device information in a tabular format. Prioritize key actions such as 'Block' and 'Pause' for easy access. Implement a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- Subtle transitions when updating device statuses or applying new schedules to improve user feedback. Incorporate animated data visualizations to enhance user engagement.
- Dark Mode: Implement a dark theme for improved user experience in low-light environments. Use dark grays for primary surfaces and desaturated colors for UI elements.
