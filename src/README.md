# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Architectural Vision for a Real-World Application

This project is currently built as a web application using Next.js, which is perfect for developing the user interface and the AI-powered logic. However, due to browser security limitations, a web application cannot directly scan a user's local network. The current version uses **simulated data** (`src/lib/data.ts`) to allow for rapid UI and feature development.

To evolve this prototype into a real-world product capable of scanning a WiFi network in real-time, the recommended architecture is to package this web application into a desktop application using a framework like **Electron**.

### How it would work:

1.  **Electron Wrapper**: The Next.js application would serve as the UI layer within an Electron application.
2.  **Local Network Access**: The Electron main process (running on Node.js) would have the necessary permissions to run real-time network scanning scripts. The data from these scans would be used directly and not stored, aligning with the goal of a privacy-focused tool.
3.  **Communication**: The React frontend would communicate with the Electron main process to get the list of devices and send commands (e.g., block device).

This approach allows us to keep the entire modern web frontend we are building while gaining the system-level capabilities needed for a real network security tool. All development on the UI and AI features in this project is directly reusable for that future goal.
